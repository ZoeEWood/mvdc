##This a tutorial adapted from Edward Snowden's video to Glenn Greenwald about how to create and use a PGP key.

On December 1, 2012, Glenn Greenwald received his first communication with Edward Snowden. This communication was anonymous, and in the form of an email that simply urged Greenwald to consdier using a PGP encryption so that the anonymous contact could convey some vitally important information. 

In Greenwald's own words, a PGP encryption is a program that "wraps every email in a protective shield, which is a cod ecomposed of hundreds, or even thousands, of random numbers and case-sensitive letters." He adds, "People who most fear having their communications monitored, such as intelligence operatives, spies, human rights activists, and hackers, trust this form of encryption to protect their messages." 

Still, Greenwald was not enticed by the anonymous Snowden's email, nor did the nudge towards more secure methods of contact come as a surprise. By December of 2012, Greenwald had long been writing for Wikileaks and for whistleblowers as well as for a few individuals inside the US national security establishment. As such he was too busy to take on a story propsed by an anonymous source unwilling to give up even the smallest hint of information without a drastically enhanced medium of communcation. So Greenwald ingnored Snowden's first attempt at contact. 

After severals more attempts by Snowden to get into contact anonymously and Greenwald's inaction, Snowden increased his efforts. He put togeter a video for Greenwald called PGP for Journalists. The video provides a very clear, step-by-step guide to installing GPG on a Windows computer, narrated by Snowden himself. 

Greenwald ultimately ignored this attempt at communication as well -- it wasn't until several months later that Greenwald jumped into action to begin reporting the Snowden story. However, the video can now be found on youtube and, despite its fewer than 4,000 views, is actually a very helpful tutorial. A fun bonus is Snowden's very charming and particular sense of humor. The following is a clarified and annotated transcription of Snowden's video.
