##This a tutorial adapted from Edward
##Snowden's video to Glenn Greenwald about 
##how to create and use a PGP key.

On December 1, 2012, Glenn Greenwald received his first communication with Edward Snowden. This communication was anonymous, and in the form of an email that simply urged Greenwald to consdier using a PGP encryption so that the anonymous contact could convey some vitally important information. 

In Greenwald's own words, a PGP encryption is a program that "wraps every email in a protective shield, which is a cod ecomposed of hundreds, or even thousands, of random numbers and case-sensitive letters." He adds, "People who most fear having their communications monitored, such as intelligence operatives, spies, human rights activists, and hackers, trust this form of encryption to protect their messages."
